# Pipex
Pipex is a command-line tool that emulates the shell pipeline operator (`|`). It allows us to chain commands together, with each one processing the output of the previous. Think of it as an assembly line for data processing. Simplify tasks like filtering, transforming, and analyzing data from various sources.  

Whether we're working with log files or conducting data analysis, Pipex streamlines the entire pipeline process.
Creating this project challegend and improved our understanding of Unix-like systems, focusing on process creation, file descriptors, and system calls. It's a practical tool with valuable insights into the core mechanisms of modern computing.
